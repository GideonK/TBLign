Changes to be implemented
=========================

- include documentation for rule keys
- make and add withalign-i and wordalign-i sets (intersection of rule-based bottom-up heuristic) for test set
- include heuristic scripts, then change README files for each data set where it says "In future versions, we will include the script as well."
- do not create directories 0, 1, 2, etc. in working directory but do everything in the same directory in order to save space
- add header to "Best rule to be applied" in Bash scripts to explain the meaning of the rule lines
- introduce the option to write the results of testing and training to a local directory
- introduce the option to set a maximum number of rules to be learned
- Other ideas may follow...
